# cuteNTR

cuteNTR is intended to be a cross platform debugger and streaming client for
NTR CFW for 3DS.

## Current status

Basic NTR debbuger functionality is implemented, but no capability of sending
commands or reading packets is implemented yet.  Sending the command to start
streaming works, but viewing the stream is not implemented yet.
